# DataSerializer
A C# Data Serialization Wrapper for my game dev. Please read Data Manager as an entry point.

# Functionality
- DataManager: The class exposed to the user. The user should only access DataManager class to do all the operations.
- DataConstants: Stores constants, e.g. File name, file directory.
- CardEntity: Hold data for a specific card.
- MonsterEntity: Hold data for a specific monster.
- PlayerData: Used to store player's play data.

Note, we still need an extra dumper to dump first batch of files.
